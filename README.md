## The Ross 🚴🏼 — Sticker Pack for iMessages (iOS 10)
The Ross is a series of both animated and static stickers about the former bicycle guy at Xamarin: Ross Yates (a.k.a. Jesus Bike). If you want, you can check out his pretty face on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=15920985&sk=about).


### Design
All the stickers, app icons, and settings icons can be found [here](https://github.com/deskfolio/The-Ross/tree/master/design/assets).<br/>
All the editable stickers and icons in vector format can be found inside this [sketch file](https://github.com/deskfolio/The-Ross/blob/master/design/sketch/The%20Ross%20(Sticker%20Pack).sketch).

#### Btw
Some stickers contain nipple level of nudity, so I guess viewer discretion is advised!<br/>
All images were inspired on Microsoft’s illustration style.
